        "content": "Eevee Eevee ( Eievui evolutionis ) ( Japanese : イーブイ romanized: Eievui ), the Evolution Pokémon. It is a normal-type Pokémon with the uncanny ability to adapt masterfully to it’s surroundings, allowing it the widest known range of possible evolutions of any of the Pocket Monsters; this is due to an irregularly shaped genetic structure. They are naive by nature, which may explain their rarity in the wild, as it may indicate that they have become critically endangered , and even more likely close to becoming extinct in the wild , as they are almost exclusively found in cities and towns. Nothing is officially known though, except that this species has a strong repel of your balls (maybe you should wash them mate). Known evolutions, more commonly referred to as \"eeveelutions\", are listed below: Contents Biology [ ] Eevee are mammalians, they have long, pointed ears. They have primarily brown fur (silver in the case of shiny Pokémon), with a cream coloration to both the tip of their bushy tails and a large furry collar. Their short, slender legs have three small toes, with footpads of a pink hue. Their eyes are brown, while their small nose is black. Making them look like a dog. Eevee are a mix of rabbit, cat, and fox. It's a common misconception that they're only foxes based on their fox-like tails, but their rabbit-like ears and short round face disprove this. Evolutions [ ] Its wildly contrasting stages would almost make one think these all these creatures are at completely different ends of the gene pool. However, these are all, in fact, the same species. Eevee evolves into various forms depending on the conditions it is placed in. Flareon (Fire) [ ] Flareon Flareon , the Flame Pokémon, is the Fire-type evolution of this species. They have red-orange fur with yellow tufts and a yellow tail, resembling fire. They are best known for their fire manipulation and generation attacks. They evolve from Eevee that are given a fire stone. Leafeon (Grass) [ ] Leafeon Leafeon , the Verdant Pokémon, is Eevee's Grass-type evolution, that is achieved when an Eevee levels up near a Mossy Rock or by being exposed to Leaf Stone. Though they superficially resemble a plantimal, they are actually 100% mammal. The main portion of their bodies are pale yellow, with brown socks on their feet, and their ears and tail resemble leaves and foliage. They also have multiple green leafy spurs on their body. Jolteon (Electric) [ ] Jolteon Jolteon , the Lightning Pokémon, is the evolution that is gained via exposing an Eevee to a Thunder Stone. They are yellow in color, with a white mane. Their fur appears spiky, and unlike their basic form and other final forms of their species, they appear to lack a tail. Sylveon (Fairy) [ ] Sylveon Sylveon , the Intertwining Pokémon, evolves from Eevee that are leveled up while knowing Fairy-type moves. Their fur is mostly white, with pink ears and tail, and splashes of blue on their ribbon-like feelers. These feelers enable them to read their trainer's emotions. Vaporeon (Water) [ ] Vaporeon Vaporeon , the Bubble Jet Pokémon, is the form of Eevee that is achieved when an Eevee is exposed to a Water Stone. While they superficially resemble some kind of blue merlion, with their fish-like fins and tail, they are actually 100% mammal. When an Eevee evolves into this stage, their ears turn into fins, and they gain a large dorsal fin on their heads. Espeon (Psychic) [ ] Espeon Espeon , the Sun Pokémon, is the form achieved through either leveling up an Eevee with high Friendship during the day, or levelling up with high Friendship and a Sun Shard. They can be distinguished by their slender form, lavender body, forked tail and what appears to be a red gem on their foreheads. They share physical characteristics with the Nekomata and the Carbuncle. Umbreon (Dark) [ ] Umbreon Umbreon , the Moonlight Pokémon, is the form achieved through either leveling up an Eevee with high Friendship during the night, or levelling up with high Friendship and a Moon Shard. They are black all over with deep scarlet eyes, and yellow ring-shaped markings can be found on their shoulders and thighs, forehead, and around their long pointed ears and tail. They are slender and sleek in build. Glaceon (Ice) [ ] Glaceon Glaceon , the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is the evolution of Eevee that is obtained when an Eevee is exposed to an Ice Stone. They are a frosty pale blue in color, with darker blue markings, and they have angular ears, tails and facial features that resemble icicles.

She is the adopted daughter of Loid and Yor Forger . She attends Eden Academy as a first-year student in Cecile Hall, Class 3. Anya, formerly known as Test Subject \"007\" ( 被験体\"007\" , Hikentai \"007\" ? ) , is also a telepath whose abilities were created in an experiment conducted by an unknown organization. Contents Appearance Anya is a short young girl with fair skin and emerald green eyes. At the time of their first meeting, Loid describes her as appearing about four to five years old at the oldest. [ 10 ] Anya's eyes are large and oval-shaped, with prominent eyelashes. She has shoulder-length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes and a small strand of ahoge at the top of her head. Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers, and many of the insults that Damian and his friends direct at her target her small size. However, in Damian's view, she gains a prettier appearance. When Loid met Anya for the first time in the orphanage, she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She usually wears this outfit when at home. Anya also wears two black hair ornaments with bright yellow embellishments resembling small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is rarely seen without her hair ornaments, even wearing them to sleep. The only other times where she is shown to not be wearing them were in her past [ 11 ] and at the end-of-class gala [ 12 ] , in which her hair is tied into small buns in place of the ornaments. At Eden Academy, Anya wears the standard uniform with white knee-high socks and black Mary Janes. She carries around a brown schoolbag with a sheep keychain attached. During physical education class, Anya ties her hair back with a red headband when wearing the school gym uniform, along with white socks and gym shoes [ 13 ] . When she was younger, her hair was slightly shorter and wore clothing that resembled scrubs . [ 11 ] Personality Anya admiring Loid for being a cool liar As a young child, Anya is very impressionable towards the people around her. For instance, reading Loid's mind and attempting to mimic him, and learning how to punch from Yor. Given her telepathic ability, which ostracized her from people and her many foster homes, Anya instantly took to \"Twilight\" for being a real spy. Since being adopted, she wanted to go wherever he was going in hopes of seeing the spy stuff she always sees on TV. However, shortly after being adopted by Loid, she learns of the harshness of espionage and does her best not to interfere with his spy work. Despite this, Anya enjoys spy cartoons, her favorite being Spy Wars , and is often seen watching it whenever she can. Anya also finds excitement in Loid and Yor's secret jobs and identities. Anya is quite clever, being able to spell long words by herself and helping Loid out as best she can, even nudging Loid and Yor together. Anya's egocentrism in wanting to be recognized Anya's behavior portrays her as younger than the age she initially claimed to be, which is around 6 years old. In reality, Anya is about 5 years old, and she pretended to be 6 after reading Loid's mind and realizing he needed a 6-year-old child. Loid, being supernaturally astute, had initially estimated her age to be younger than six. Anya's demeanor reflects her young age, as she is gregarious, trusting, simple-minded, and easily distracted. She may not fully grasp the bigger picture or see the grand scheme of things, which is typical for children her age. Anya, like many young children, is self-centered and unaware of how her actions affect others. She opposes Nightfall as her \"mother\" due to the fear of becoming an honor student through harsh methods. She is impulsive, breaking rules for excitement, and easily changes plans for personal gains, such as treats or awards. This is not to say she is unintelligent or narcissistic, as it is common for young children to be unable to fully consider others' needs at such a young age. Given her younger age, it is remarkable that Anya can keep up with an advanced curriculum designed for older children. While some may perceive her as intellectually lacking for a six-year-old, she is most likely a highly gifted, talented, and precocious young girl, showcasing impressive abilities for her age. Anya makes her plan to befriend Damian Anya is shown to understand complex certain situations and what solutions are necessary but not the more abstract parts of it. For example, she comes up with clever plans to befriend Damian, the second son of Loid's target , in order to help Loid's mission . She has attempted to help him with an art project and use her dog, Bond , as bait for an invitation to his house after reading his mind and learning he loves dogs. However, she failed to realize that her lack of art skills was not only not helping him but actually making him hate her more, or the fact that a kid who has repeatedly expressed his intense disdain for her would effortlessly become her best friend because they both have dogs. Anya dreams of world peace One of Anya's most remarkable traits is that she does everything she can to help Loid in his mission to prevent a war and \"achieve world peace,\" although in a childlike and innocent way. As such, she puts all her effort into getting close to Damian, to help Loid accomplish his mission. Anya is often seen creating \"plans\" that might help her get along with him. Anya's primary flaw lies in her inability to see the bigger picture, often fixating only on immediate desires or goals. Despite her strong desire to assist Loid with his mission and excel academically, she consistently neglects her studies and fails to grasp how her impulsive actions may be perceived by others or their long-term consequences. Anya does not want to be rejected Anya's tendency to keep her telepathy hidden stems from both orders by the facility's doctors and her fear of social rejection and family disruption. This fear contributes to her inclination to act without considering the broader implications of her actions. One notable example of her shortsightedness is her failure to realize that revealing her ability to Loid would be of great help to him. Additionally, after learning about Loid's dangerous spy mission to prevent a world-threatening situation, Anya eagerly accepts the opportunity without fully understanding the potential risks and dangers involved. Despite her flaws, Anya's intentions are often driven by a genuine desire to assist others, even if she lacks the ability to see the larger consequences of her choices. This is notably seen with her adopted parents, where she aided them in their respective occupations, unbeknownst to them or her acknowledgment of their true jobs. Anya cries for her \"real\" mother Anya's upbringing in the unknown facility and getting returned from foster homes have left her with significant abandonment issues, driving her desperate desire for a loving family. This motivation leads her to assist Loid and Yor in maintaining their family bond. She is emotionally affected by the fear of being replaced or left behind, and the potential revelation of family secrets causes her distress. Also, the subject of her \"real\" mother is a sensitive and emotional topic for her, evoking tears when brought up. Anya's aversion to studying arises from being compelled to focus on honing her special \"gift\" during her time there. She most notably has a problem of relying on reading other people's minds for answers rather than actually studying the material, which comes back to bite her when she reads the wrong answers. However, despite enduring difficulties in the facility, Anya remains relatively persistent, diligent, and optimistic. Anya's empathetic side Anya's ability to read minds has its advantages, enabling her to form deep connections with others, as demonstrated by her ability to calm a distressed cow and save a drowning child. But it also poses challenges, as she instinctively reacts to thoughts she telepathically picks up which often makes her seem eccentric and unhinged. Besides, Anya relies too much on her \"gift\" and can hardly function without it. Her lack of situational awareness and social skills also make matters worse, leading to erratic behavior and conflicts with her peers. Nonetheless, she displays a kind and empathetic side despite these struggles. However, Anya is not above being a little cocky. She is quick to show off when she does something remarkable, like when she earned a Stella Star and wore it on her uniform so everyone could see it, and even requested to be called \"Starlight Anya\" for the day. That said, it is understandable due to her being a child. Abilities and Skills Anya reads Yor's dark thoughts Telepathy: Anya is capable of reading the minds of other people and animals, her ability depicted as small sparks around her head. However, her abilities have their limits. Anya finds it difficult to understand complicated minds, such as Loid's. [ 14 ] When she reads the minds of people with excessively strong emotions, like Yuri and Fiona, it causes a reaction similar to a heartburn. [ 15 ] She must also be within a certain distance of her target to read minds. [ 16 ] Anya's involuntary use of her telepathic abilities made her a bit more aware of her surroundings. It enables her to see through Loid's disguises, hear somebody being in danger, [ 17 ] and notice Yor sneaking into her school to give her the P.E. uniform. [ 18 ] It even helps her pick up on the enemies of her parents being nearby. [ 16 ] Above Average Intelligence: Considering that Anya is actually a five-year-old child, she is still able to pass the Eden Academy exams, albeit barely, even though it is one of the best elite schools in the country. This could indicate that, although it may not seem like it, Anya is actually quite intelligent for a child her age. Anya's grade in her Classical Language test Classical Language: Compared to her other subjects, Anya is mysteriously knowledgeable of classical language , which is considered advanced in today's society. Despite having barely learned the subject at school, as Loid notices she could have scored well on her test if she did not make so many spelling mistakes. [ 19 ] After receiving tutoring from Sigmund Authen , Anya greatly improved on Classical Language and managed to get second place in the subject on her first final exam. Resourcefulness: She is shown on numerous occasions to have a decent level of street smarts, saving both Loid and Yor from potential death using her resourcefulness and quick-thinking skills. From time to time, Anya has been able to trick Loid, despite his extremely observant skills and cautious attitude and use Yor's protective nature to her advantage. She is also capable enough to design a trap and make a makeshift bomb, albeit with the knowledge of an aspiring assassin. Anya punches Damian and sends him flying Basic Self-Defense: Anya has been taught by Yor some early basic self-defense. She is strong enough to send Damian flying several feet with a punch to the face. Above Average Strength: Despite her size, Anya is capable of sending people who are slightly above her stature flying with a punch if angered. She was even capable of throwing one of Yor's stilettos onto the roof deck despite its height. [ 20 ] Special Moves After getting kidnapped by thugs, Anya asks Yor to train her to be as strong as her so she can study hard and \"not die\" at school. Yor agrees and teaches Anya several special moves. Anya creates some of her own special moves as well. Weaknesses Anya's Eclipsing Eclipsing: In a phenomenon dubbed \"Eclipsing\" by the scientists at Anya's former laboratory, [ 25 ] Anya's telepathic abilities are temporarily disabled during the new moon. General Skill: Anya is shown to be poor in a variety of skills, including studying, drawing, sports, and music. She often obtains single-digit scores for her tests and resorts to her telepathic abilities to get through classes and exams instead, refusing to study unless under Loid's strict supervision and during her \"Eclipsing.\" Even when motivated to study during her midterm exams, she just barely passes. She tries to play a child-sized violin Loid buys her but causes the strings to snap with her bad playing. Poor Grammatic: Anya has very poor grammatic skills. It is often that whenever she shows her personal notes to anyone, they cannot understand what she is writing, comparing it with a bunch of scrawls. Poor Academics: Anya has low to sub-par abilities when it comes to academics, notably scoring very low in most of the tests she has taken at Eden Academy. She seems to have an over-reliance on her telepathy skills, especially when troubled, primarily using it to answer homework questions and sometimes cheat on tests. Her poor academics can be partially attributed to the advanced material she is studying, paired with her being younger than she claims to be. Anya tries to read Loid's mind Lack of Control Over Her Power: Anya is only able to control her telepathy at a small amount, which often leads Anya to unwillingly read every single thought of everyone around her. Crowds: When Anya is exposed to huge crowds, she often tends to get dizzy or exhausted by uncontrollably reading most of the whole crowd's minds, resulting in her suffering from nosebleeds. This is especially emphasized when the crowd has aggressive [ 26 ] or generally fearful thoughts [ 27 ] [ 28 ] , as these are apparently the first thoughts that alert Anya's powers. Lack of Athletic Ability: Befitting her age, Anya is extremely poor when it comes to physical exercises, getting winded easily, having poor coordination and low strength, being unable to throw a ball properly despite Yor's training, and her putting her full strength into it. This lack of ability has extended to various sports, including tennis, jump rope, swimming, and vaulting. Over time, her athletic ability has slightly improved, as Loid has reported to Sylvia that she can now jump over two vaulting boxes and jump rope five times in a row. [ 29 ] Her throwing ability appears to have also improved, as she was able to throw Yor's stiletto from one floor to another.

What he doesn't know is that Anya is an experimental subject who escaped from a lab that gave her the power to read minds ; labeled as <Subject 007> . Starving for excitement in her life after spending a year being circulated around various orphanages, Anya actively sought to be selected by Twilight for adoption, and made sure Twilight and Yor got together so she could have a spy and an assassin as her parents. Anya is the only Forger aware of just about everyone 's Secret Identities , but keeps it to herself out of fear that if her psychic powers are exposed she'll lose her new family. If you're looking to see how she would describe herself, look over here . open/close all folders A-E Abusive Parents : Her caretakers at the lab treated her more like a tool than a child. When she wanted to draw, they coldly told her it was time to study, and to stop crying because her power was necessary for the sake of world peace. Doesn't apply to her biological mother though, who was also a test subject. Accidental Hero : Invoked ; when Loid takes her with him to the hospital note so Anya can volunteer to earn Stella Stars as a way for Loid to get close to Donovan , a boy with a broken leg wanders away from his therapist towards the therapy pool and falls in the deep end, beginning to drown. When Anya reads his distressed thoughts, she lies to Loid that she wants to go swimming, tracks down the boy's thoughts and jumps in to save him, only to start drowning herself. After Loid pulls out both children, she's asked how did she know the boy was drowning, and Anya lies by saying that when she found out the hospital had a pool she wanted to go swimming, saw the bubbles, and tried to rescue him. Acquired Situational Narcissism : After she gets her first Stella Star, she insists on wearing the pin everywhere and only being addressed as \"Starlight Anya\". Even though she is the first in her grade to get one, this is considered by academy standards to be very vain, and most students just leave theirs on a shelf or something. In Chapter 76, after the ordeal with the Red Circus , she's hailed as a hero, and immediately starts to milk the attention for all it's worth by thinking about how she can use her new-found \"friends\" to her advantage. She especially enjoys the attention, since as a \"peasant,\" one of Damian's favorite insults, her upbringing allowed her to become tough, and she offers to train the other kids to become tough as well by teaching them the lessons Yor taught her, specifically some self-defense techniques and eating her cooking . Adopt-a-Prodigy : Twilight takes Anya home from the orphanage after she impresses him by filling in the answers on a crossword puzzle meant for grown-ups. He has no idea she read the answers directly from his mind. Aesop Amnesia : After getting kidnapped in the very first chapter because she decided to play with Loid's transmission device, Anya still hasn't learned not to screw around with Loid's spy equipment, as shown in a later chapter where she decides to explore Loid's secret escape tunnel in the hospital. Justified considering she's only a little kid, around 5 years old. All of the Other Reindeer : Due to her powers she's always been seen as a weirdo and isolated as a result. The same thing happens early in her Eden school year due to her Penny Among Diamonds status, as well as her punching Damian on the first day, which causes most of her class to be scared of her, Becky being the only exception. This eventually goes away in later chapters, as her bravery during the bus hijacking and high score in classical languages improved her image. Animal Motif : Anya has a subtle cat theme: Her Horned Hairdo resembles cat ears, her eyes are bright green, she has a mischievous streak and marches to her own drum, and she hisses angrily at Nightfall in her introduction. Even the nya in \"Anya\" is Japanese for a cat's meow. It also works with her Chimera doll, whose front half is, prominently, a lion. Apparently Powerless Puppetmaster : She may be an unassuming little girl (who is actually five ), but her powers and cunning allow her to manipulate all parties to a favorable outcome when possible, such as getting Loid and Yor together or, after teaming up with a dog who can see the future, managing to foil a nefarious plot to bring war to Ostania. Art Shift : Her expressions diverge from the usual style the most out of the cast, with it being notable in that her more exaggerated expressions have some consistency between them, but several styles to choose from that dictate things like the shape of her eyes. Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny! : Anya is smart enough to make plans (of varying quality), but not mature enough to stick to them if something really interesting catches her eye, like a stack of manga, or her favorite food for dinner. Audience Surrogate : She's the only character who is privy to all of the other characters' secrets, and her main motivation is to keep her fake family together for both entertainment value and sentimentality , which likely mirrors the audiences' reasons for reading/watching the source material. And of course, they can read/listen to everyone's thoughts in the story like she can. Bad \"Bad Acting\" : Anya's attempts at lying or being dramatic like the protagonists in her favorite cartoon \"Spy Wars\" usually fail hilariously due to her tendency to \"read her lines\" in a literal, stiff, emotionless and deadpan tone. Anya retains this \"performance style\" even in Yor's Imagine Spot scenes in the anime. \"I'm Anya; I've always been Papa's daughter .\" \"Oh save me Loidman!\" (playing a pretend-Bondman scenario with herself as the captive) \"I was stretching my arms , and his face just happened to be there .\" (After punching Damian to stop him from picking on her). Badass Adorable : After being trained by Yor, Anya responds to bullying by knocking Damian right on his butt. She was very, very sorry though. She pulls off a Loid-level incapacitation of a Red Circus mook to prevent him from ruining Loid and Yor's dinner date. She even manages to bluff him into leading a normal life outside of crime by inadvertently convincing him that Yor has deadly child operatives watching her back. Bad Liar : It's usually very obvious when Anya's lying, whether because she's visibly faking or about to blurt out the truth. Any time she gets away with it, it's mainly because people go along with it or aren't expecting it. Be Careful What You Wish For : She thinks Bondman having a silenced pistol is super cool and wants one for herself. After seeing one used by a criminal while kidnapped, she finds that a pistol with a silencer doesn't sound so appealing anymore. Beautiful Tears : When Anya goes to apologize to Damian for slighting him, the sight of her sparkly-eyed and red-faced sobbing makes Damian start blushing furiously and his heart start hammering. Beware the Nice Ones : As Damian has learned from a day one punch to the face, pissing her off is not a good idea. Blessed with Suck : While her telepathy has its uses, there's always the consequence of learning thoughts that she may find shocking, hurtful, etc. For example, while trying to apologize to Damian for hitting him, Anya kept hearing his friends' thoughts which were insults about her that caused her to cry. Moreso, the very existence of Anya's powers is the reason she was treated like a lab rat and isolated from other people until she ran away from the institution, as well as being bounced between the orphanage and several potential adoptive parents afterwards. Played with. Anya's telepathic powers' biggest impediment is the fact that Anya herself is a little girl. She does her best with the information she gathers, but there's only so much she can do with what she has. For instance, her powers give her little to no edge academically because she initially doesn't know whose mind to read to cheat, and later due to not wanting to cheat given the risk of being ridiculed by other students if she suddenly improves. However, due to her adventurous nature and love for spy shows, her efforts to both help and protect Yor and Loid during their missions do pay off. She's excellent outside of school. Book Dumb : She's incredibly intelligent and helps her parents with their various missions on multiple occasions without being detected herself. She's also shown to be an astute observational learner, able to pick up on espionage tactics just by watching Loid and quickly picked up how to fight from Yor. However, even when she's motivated to try, she's a mediocre student at best and consistently scores low on her exams, partly due to her over-reliance on her mind-reading powers to cheat without learning anything. Not helping matters is that she's probably pretending to be a year or two older than she actually is (which puts her at a massive disadvantage compared to her peers, at an elite private school no less), as well as the fact studying reminds her too much of her time spent at the lab. However, by Chapter 27 Loid discovers that she actually is learning and would've gotten higher marks on her exam were it not for her terrible handwriting . Once Sigmund Authen comes into her life, he helps even more by using his skills as a teacher to cultivate not just knowledge, but a love of learning for its own sake, which actually elevates all her other subjects... except math (and even this score was only so bad due to Anya being exhausted from the previous test). As of Chapter 93, her class ranking is 168th out of 228 students, a step up from her previous rank of 213th. This is briefly averted when Loid realizes she pays attention if something correlates with her interests. So while she normally has trouble with math problems (namely, basic fractions), she can instantly figure out that if Bondman only has two bullets left in a gun that can hold eight, that means he has two-eighths. In Short Mission 9, it even leads him (with Franky's aid) to create a \"new episode\" of her Spy Wars show to exploit this... except that the educational info he wishes to teach her is shoehorned in and quite verbose, so Anya can't follow it at all (leading her to say the episode sucks). The exception to this rule is Classical Language, which Anya shows a surprising proclivity for . With help from her new neighbor Sigmund Authen, Anya is able to get the second-highest score in the term finals for the subject, and with it her third Stella Star. Breaking the Fourth Wall : Episode 17 has her giving the recap of the prior episode. Brilliant, but Lazy : She's extremely smart, assisting and manipulating her parents multiple times, all the while able to keep her telepathy hidden. However, it's shown that she has a tendency to rely on her telepathy to get her way. This can backfire on her when she's in a situation where someone isn't focusing on the issue she needs to solve, or the people around her can't figure it out either. Brutal Honesty : Being six (possibly even younger), she has no filter, and is very frank in telling Yor that she's terrible at cooking. Cassandra Truth : Is afraid of this if she tells her parents something she logically couldn't have known, which would possibly lead to them learning about her powers. Averted in the \"Inusan Crisis Arc\" when she tells Yor about the terrorists and bomb-dogs plan, who not only believes her, but also does everything she can to beat the crap out of said terrorists. In a serious moment between the two she outright tells Damian that she can read people's minds in Mission 96, but after a moment of hesitation he understandably claims she's making things up and the two get into another argument despite obviously bonding closer. Downplayed in that his initial reaction and expression indicates part of him may believe her, especially with the later revelation that his own father might have similar powers . Casting Gag : Anya is not the first character Atsumi Tanezaki has played that is an empathetic child with telepathic powers . Character Catchphrase : Since a large portion of stuff she does is because she's starved for entertainment , she has a habit of thinking or saying \"Waku Waku!\" (translated as \"So exciting!\" or \"So cool!\" in English) whenever she sees something that piques her interest, with the first time being the moment she realizes how awesome it would be to have a spy as a father (and again while having an assassin as a mother). Character Development : A subtle, but noticeable change regarding her intelligence. As the series goes on, Anya relies on her powers less and less as she opts to gain knowledge without them. It pays off as she is ranked 168 out of 228 students in terms of academics. Character Focus : The Bus Arc is shown through Anya's P.O.V. , since Loid and Yor were absent, and thus not available to save the day or participate in any of the action. note Loid was out of town on a mission, albeit he did show up disguised as a solider by the end . Cheerful Child : She's a bubbly and adorable little kid who's absolutely thrilled to have a badass spy and assassin for parents. She's characterized by typical childish mischief and playfulness, and being very friendly and outgoing. Cheery Pink : Along with being cheerful , she also has pink hair . Clingy Child : When Twilight first adopts Anya, she clings to his leg until he takes her with him when he goes shopping because of her fear of abandonment. Combat Clairvoyance : During a game of dodgeball, she used her telepathy on Bill Watkins to know where he would be aiming, allowing her to preemptively dodge his shots. Combination Attack : Her and Bond's powers are complementary and using both in tandem upgrades their Story-Breaker status to even more Story-Breaking. Bond can see the future but can't communicate what he sees since he's a dog. Anya can't see the future, but she can see what Bond sees and manipulate the people around her to solve the issue. If they were to take a more active role in the conflict, they'd probably resolve it before it even happened. Fully demonstrated in Chapter 94, where a typical murder mystery situation in a secluded location gets resolved in just a few panels thanks to Anya's and Bond's powers. Comically Missing the Point : Anya has a tendency to do this out of childlike naivety, usually to Loid's chagrin. Conditioned to Accept Horror : By Mission 29, Anya appears to have gotten used to her adoptive mother's graphically violent daydreams, since she just looks annoyed when Yor subjects her to yet another gruesome scenario. Cosmic Motifs : Stars, symbolizing hope and unity. Apart from her goal of earning Stella merits, she demands that others address her as \"Starlight\" Anya when she's feeling arrogant, her name can be read as \"dark night\", and the only times she's alone in her head are when nothing but stars are visible in the sky. Couldn't Find a Pen : In the \"Inusan Crisis\" arc, she hastily writes a warning with ketchup to tell Loid that there's a bomb hidden behind a door he was about to open. However, her choice of drawing a bomb instead of writing it gets it briefly mistaken as a weird warning about an eggplant until Loid gets suspicious and discovers the bomb anyway. Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass : She may not be the best student, but she’s still able to do incredible things outside of her age range. For one, she was successful in creating a small explosive just by reading the Red Circus survivor’s mind. Not only was she able to make a small non lethal explosive out of a kitchen, she did it all without any visual demonstration in making one! Crush Filter : Inverted in regards to Damian. While Damian sees Anya as being cuter than she already is, Anya sees him as a bug-eyed goof with a trail of snot hanging out of his nose, as seen in these examples . Curious as a Monkey : Being a little girl, Anya can be very curious and this sometimes gets her into trouble. In Code: White , she finds a key while aboard a train and decides to use it to unlock a hidden trunk which Bond sees in his future vision. It has nothing inside but a single chocolate truffle, which she accidentally eats. The bad guys come after her because the chocolate has a crucial piece of microfilm hidden inside. Cute Bruiser : As far as other kids are concerned, which is shown when she sends Damian flying with a single punch. Though it's more Played for Laughs than for awesomeness. The Cutie : Anya was probably designed to be the most heart-meltingly adorable character you'll ever see. Her childish curiosity and naivete are played for as many humorous and heartwarming moments possible, being what helps soften up the otherwise professional and distant Loid who's never had to care for another human like her. Likewise, others in-universe like Yor find Anya immensely cute. Cuteness Proximity : When Loid brings Anya to work as part of her homework, his co-workers immediately fawn over her and call her the cutest thing while rushing to give her candy and compliments. Daddy's Girl : Downplayed; while she does sincerely love both her parents with all her heart, she does express a more emotional attachment to Loid. She adores him, thinks his work as a spy is the coolest thing ever, tries to emulate his behavior, wants to earn his love and respect as her reason for trying hard at school (even though she doesn't like studying), and constantly helps him out on his missions in secret. Damsel in Distress : Whenever the narrative needs something to motivate Loid and Yor, to the point they even risk their masquerade, it typically leads to Anya being imperiled in some way. It's subverted during the Red Circus arc, however, in that though Yor arrives to pick Anya up and Loid was finding a way to secure the captive children, it's ultimately Anya's actions that save the day when the Red Circus kidnaps her class. Dark and Troubled Past : When Mr. Swan asks Anya whether she prefers Yor or her birth mom, it causes Anya to reopen a locked door in her mind and begin softly crying \"Mama\". The smug smile on Mr. Swan's face is what makes Twilight almost punch him (and the average reader cheer when Mr. Henderson finally does). Determinator : It takes guts to believe in people when you've been through several foster homes, but no amount of trauma can stop Anya from making her life better- and everyone else's, too. Ditzy Genius : While she is very intelligent, curious and intuitive, and has a good memory, Anya is also uncomfortable with large crowds and does not feel at ease when she's at school. Indeed, she's Book Dumb despite her smarts. Do Well, But Not Perfect : Something she has to deal with regarding her mind reading. Since she needs to keep her ability hidden, she can't use a lot of the information she obtains, especially if she can't convincingly explain how. For instance, when playing cards she wins so easily that the other players assume she's cheating somehow, so she agrees to play again to do worse and dismiss her first victory as a fluke. Does Not Like Spam : When she tells Loid she likes peanuts , she also admits that she thinks carrots are gross, which is quite usual for Japanese children in real life. Dragged by the Collar : Anya is so small that Loid can just pick her up by the back of her shirt or dress and carry her away if she's being uncooperative. Drama-Preserving Handicap : In a series that is centered around lies, facades, and espionage Anya has the incredible power to read minds. This would make her capable of easily addressing many of the problems that arise, except for one issue. Namely, that she's no older than six (and probably younger); her grasp on subterfuge is poor, she can easily get distracted, often forgets what she's supposed to be doing or saying, and doesn't really understand a lot of what's going on around her. When she's on the ball she can be remarkably effective, but all too often she isn't. Her mind-reading powers are hampered by crowds, not just because of the sheer amount of thoughts going on around her (making picking out one in particular difficult), but because past a certain point of intensity the thoughts will push into her mind, making tuning them out virtually a non-option. It also makes it difficult for her to cheat during school tests , as even if she knows who's the smartest student, she still has to contend with the thoughts of dozens of others simultaneously (among other issues), forcing her to improve her poor grades the hard way. Dramatic Irony : Her telepathy frequently makes her an In-Universe subject to this, as she's the only one around who is able to directly read other people's thoughts and get the full picture of what's happening, but due to her own desire to hide her powers and keep her Found Family together, she often can't outright just tell people why or how she knows what she does, and has to invent excuses reliant on her childishness to save the day without anybody knowing. As the premier example, Anya is the only one in the family who's fully aware of the secrets the others are keeping regarding their own Secret Identity , and in several cases has often helped her mama or papa keep The Masquerade going, whilst they assume it's good fortune on their behalf that she's helping them out, rather than knowingly aiding them. The Dreaded : Punching Damian causes all the other kids in their class (except Becky) to avoid her on their first day. Other kids: \"What if she murders me?!\" \"She's like a total psycho!\" Dreadful Musician : Her poor attempt at playing the violin convinces Loid that she won't ever get a star in music class. Dub Pronunciation Change : Her name, as written in Japanese, is アーニャ, of which the closest English approximation would be something between AH-na and AH-ni-a. However, the English dub always reads her name as AHN-ya. Early Installment Character-Design Difference : Her eyes are noticeably incredibly detailed and doll-like during the first couple of chapters of the manga, almost jarringly so compared to the eyes of the other characters. The detail begins lessening as the focus is put more on giving her a variety of goofy facial expressions. The Empath : Along with her telepathy, she can also sense others' feelings, as shown when she was able to calm down a scared cow. Her young age does mean she has trouble grasping the meaning of certain emotions though, in particular romantic love . Enlightened Self-Interest : Played for laughs. After being awarded a Stella Star for helping save a drowning child out of the goodness of her own heart, Anya starts cottoning on to the idea that she can earn them through doing more heroic deeds. When she finds herself mired in a terrorist plot to use dogs to assassinate visiting politicians, she has a moment of clarity where she considers finding a way to spin this into getting another Stella Star if she can somehow foil the scheme publicly. Epic Fail : Anytime she is given a task to do (sports, crafting, volunteering, school work, etc), expect her to do very badly at it. Escaped from the Lab : She's a test subject of a project to create psychic children. She escaped the facility that experimented on her and eventually ended up at the orphanage where she is adopted by Loid. Establishing Character Moment : Her very first scene has Anya using her telepathy to solve a Crossword Puzzle so Loid will think she's smart and adopt her. This immediately showcases her two most defining traits: that she's a Guile Heroine , and that she desperately wants to have a loving family. Everything's Better with Sparkles : Whenever she uses her telepathy , sparkles are often shown around her head to let the viewer know that she is using a supernatural ability. Explaining Your Powers to the Enemy : Defied. What makes Anya so effective is that she doesn't tell people about her powers, which is especially rare for fictional Telepathy . She consciously avoids telling her new parents about her powers since she's afraid she'll get sent back to the orphanage or the lab she came from if they find out about her true nature. Explosive Leash : After Billy Squire sees Anya and Becky acting suspiciously (throwing out a message for someone to find), he places a bomb collar on Anya. He threatens the children of Eden that if they attempt to save her or escape, she will die, though Anya discovers that the bomb collar is a fake via her telepathy. F-N Face of a Thug : Downplayed . She's cute as a button, but she has the unintentional habit of making incredibly smug faces which are typically directed at Damian, often giving the impression that she's intentionally mocking him. Fangirl : She's a big fan of a spy cartoon called Spy Wars which is probably one of the main reasons she loves being adopted by Loid (a master spy) and Yor (a professional hitwoman). Almost all of her fantasies are filtered through a Spy Fiction lens inspired by the show. Case in point, as a reward for getting into Eden, Loid arranges a gigantic Spy Wars LARP campaign for her, where she is a princess that Loid— dressed as the hero of the cartoon, Bondman— must rescue from a bombastic Supervillain . She loved the whole experience. Fatal Flaw : Her abandonment issues. Having been adopted and returned four times has caused Anya to deeply long for a family to love and fear the thought of being returned. To that end she constantly does her best to help both of her foster parents the best she can hoping they will want to keep her. This behavior also causes Anya a lot of problems because she's so obsessed with keeping the family she has now she's gotten in trouble with villains resulting in Loid or Yor having to save her. She also lies to her parents about going off to do something dangerous because she's paranoid of being outed as a telepath, believing it would cause Twilight to abandon her. This is justified, as Anya is only a small child who is too immature to understand the process of thinking many of the things she does through. Flaw Exploitation : She knows her father would do anything to make sure Operation Strix succeeds, a fact she exploits for reasons both noble (giving Bond a family) and not (making Loid buy her cake). Foster Kid : During the year before she met Loid, Anya went through four foster homes, contributing to deeply-rooted attachment issues. Freak Lab Accident : Anya getting her powers was an unintentional result of the scientists' experiments that they took advantage of. Freudian Excuse : Anya's hatred of studying comes from the scientists at the lab where she was experimented on forcing her to study even when she didn't want to. Loid attempting the same tactics on her for the sake of the mission brings back bad memories for Anya and she runs off to her room to cry. She does slowly overcome this over time, with Loid learning to be a better father to her and attempting to help her education in other ways. Having been put in foster care and returned four times, Anya is very scared of the thought of being returned to the orphanage. The first chapter has her crying hysterically upon reading Loid's thoughts about potentially returning her for another child. It's implied Anya is determined to help Loid make Operation STRIX succeed so that she'll impress him enough that he'll want to keep her. Likewise, this fear has led to her obsessive need to keep her powers a secret (to the point of sometimes increasing danger to herself and others in order to avoid revealing what she can do), as she's certain that she will be abandoned if her adoptive family finds out. Funetik Aksent : She tends to pronounce words that she doesn't understand this way. For instance, when she \"hears\" Loid think about how Damian is the scion of the Desmond family, she proceeds to start thinking about him as the \"Sy-on Boy\", not knowing what \"scion\" means; although in some dubs, she calls him \"second son\" instead, which is more accurate to the original Japanese. Geeky Turn-On : In chapter 113, she shows great interest in the cardboard gauntlet Damian is wearing to school and asks if it has any special powers (just panels after Becky told him no girl would ever think he was cool if he kept wearing it). Girly Girl with a Tomboy Streak : While she is into plushies and the idea of being a princess, Anya’s interest and attention span is mainly focused outside of girlish things, such as physical sports and cartoons. In fact, things like romance movies bore her. Girls Love Stuffed Animals : She carries around a Classical Chimera plushie, alluding to her lab experiment past . She also adores the giant penguin plushie her adoptive father got for her at the aquarium. Glory Seeker : Anya really likes being feted as a hero- especially because she's been sorely deprived of positive attention for most of her life. One of the few things she doesn't like about spy work is the lack of recognition involved. Grade Skipper : An implied unintentional case. It's possible that Anya lied about her age so Loid would adopt her, so she's placed in a grade at Eden College for children a year or two older than her. Her academic performance can't exactly be called impressive, but she does manage to just keep up with her class. The Greatest Story Never Told : She has helped both of her parents from behind the scenes with them being none the wiser, with her biggest case in the Inusan Crisis arc where she manages to prevent both Westalis and Ostania from breaking out into war. Guile Heroine : Thanks to her mind-reading powers, it's very easy for her to find out what makes her target tick. A few words out of her mouth, and maybe a bit of acting, and the target will perform the action she wants. For example, need to stop an escaping terrorist? Hug his leg and shout \"Mama, I'm being kidnapped!\". Cue Yor's Mama Bear rage. Happily Adopted : She is fully aware of her new parents' identities thanks to her powers, but she loves her new life very much. It helps that she wants to have a loving family more than anything else and exploits people to that end , but the Forgers do come to genuinely care about her. Hates Being Alone : Anya was abused and exploited by the lab that raised her. She's since then also been adopted and returned several times due to people not being able to handle her and her telepathy. All of this has caused her to develop severe abandonment issues. She is thus incredibly clingy with her new parents, wanting to have a true bond with them and avoid being abandoned once more. The Heart : Anya is the center of her fake family, with both Loid and Yor quickly growing attached to her, which slowly helps them to grow fonder of each other too. Heartwarming Orphan : Anya was an orphan adopted by multiple families and was easily dropped in each one due to her powers, hence why she hides it from everyone ever since she became a Forger. Her cheerfulness and innocence crept into the hearts of her adopted parents, Loid and Yor, both of whom have rather ruthless jobs. She even instantly befriended the family's dog, Bond. Heroes Love Dogs : She decides to get a dog in hopes that'll help her make friends with Damian. She then finds a dog that can see the future and decides to keep him. She names him Bond and they become the best of friends. Hero with Bad Publicity : In terms of school reputation, she's this. Due to her generally poor academic performance and her punching Damian during her first day at the academy, she's considered a delinquent by the other students and some of the teachers as well. Eventually averted after the bus hijacking arc, where many students start to view her as a real hero for her brave actions. Hidden Depths : Mission 42 reveals that she's actually knowledgeable of classical language, as Loid observes that she could've gotten a good score on her classical language quiz had her spelling not been atrocious . Later, in large part thanks to Sigmund's tutoring, Anya gets the second-highest score in her exams, earning her third Stella Star as a result. Huge Guy, Tiny Girl : The Tiny Girl to Loid's Huge Guy. Anya is 99.5cm (3'3). Even with the fact she's a year younger than most of her classmates, she's shorter than all of them. Meanwhile, her foster father is one of the tallest characters in the series, being 187cm (6'2''). I Have Many Names : Throughout her short life she has been called Test Subject 007, Anya Williams, Anya Levski, Anya Roche, Anya Klein, and now Anya Forger. Franky says to Loid, \"She changes names as much as you do.\" Short Mission 11 hints that her original given name is Ania. I Just Want to Be Loved : Why Anya is so dead-set on pairing up Loid and Yor. Having been raised in a sterile lab environment followed by several foster homes and orphanages without any love, she wants to be with a loving family of her own. The thought of Loid and Yor abandoning her is a deep-seated anxiety she expresses in tense moments, like their disastrous entrance interview for Eden. The Illegible : Her handwriting is so awful that it's almost totally illegible. In fact, it’s a wonder how she even made it as far as she did academically. Imagine Spotting : She can see what others are imagining thanks to her telepathy. Improperly Paranoid : Played for Laughs and Drama both. Anya's fears about Twilight abandoning her after the mission is over were at least partially justified at first, where he was planning to do just that, and they stem from her own profound abandonment issues as an orphan mistreated by many of the adult authority figures in her life before she got recruited for Operation STRIX. But it's also shown that Twilight has grown increasingly attached to his \"fake\" family in ways he himself is unaware of or willfully ignorant about, which Anya, being a five year old girl, doesn't pick up on at all. She also frequently has silly Imagine Spots where she uses crazy non-logic to conclude Twilight might abandon her for ridiculous reasons if she doesn't get up to the Zany Scheme of the week. Finally, swinging back to drama, Bond's vision of the Bad Future where Keith Kepler succeeded in killing Twilight and sparking a massive war at least strongly suggests that Yor wouldn't abandon Anya even without Twilight in the picture; they're shown to still be together, if emotionally devastated. Inconsistent Spelling : Even aside localization, her given name has multiple spelling. It's written on her adoption forms \"Anya\" (and nearly every official out-of-universe source), but her room's name plate was written as \"ANIA\" . Short Mission 11 acknowledges the difference, but implies both spellings exist and are meaningfully different in-series . Interclass Friendship : With Becky. Anya is an orphan who was adopted by a spy and is now living as part of a middle class family, while her Only Friend Becky is the daughter of a CEO who is so rich that Anya wonders if Becky's family has enough money to rule the world. Irony : She's a telepath unable to discern Damian is mean to her because he has a crush on her. Despite having practice doing so to her parents and her ability to outright read minds, Anya's contempt for Damian, combined with the above inability to realize how his mind works, makes her believe that he'll be easy to manipulate with minimal effort on her part, causing all her friendship attempts to fail over and over again. It Amused Me : A non-malicious reason. Many of the actions she does to help Loid and Yor are because she is starved for excitement. This includes working to get Loid as her dad and then Yor as her mom in the first place, as she considers having a spy and assassin for parents super exciting. It Was a Gift : In Short Mission 3, after Anya's penguin plushie was tattered by Bond and made worse by Yor's attempt to fix it, Loid suggests to buy a new one for her. Anya refuses, as she has grown attached to it, especially since it was a gift from Loid after winning it in Extra Mission 1. Kid Hero : Deconstructed. While Anya's telepathy and quick wit has helped — and even saved — her family and world peace, she is still a child who is out of her depth in tasks outside of her capabilities. There is much that she doesn't fully understand about the world due to having the naïve view of the world that most children do. Let's You and Him Fight : If she needs to have an adult threat removed, her go-to method is siccing her parents onto them, such as clutching onto a terrorist and yelling to Yor that she's being kidnapped, who reacts just as you'd expect . Living Lie Detector : She can read minds, so she knows every time Twilight is lying to her. She still finds him very cool. \"Papa's a big liar.\" Logical Weakness : As convenient as mind-reading might seem, Anya's powers come with a lot of caveats. Anya can still read the minds of people whose thoughts are in disarray or Angrish due to heightened emotional state, but she won't be able to make sense of it . Likewise, big crowds of people overwhelm her thanks to the massive amount of thoughts going around, which her parents assume to be a fear of crowds. Combine a crowd with strong emotions and the effect is even worse. A panicked crowd early in the series outright causes Anya to pass out for a short time because she was so overwhelmed. Much later, during her bus' hijacking, she is repeatedly incapacitated when the rest of the kids on her bus get panicked enough. She has trouble keeping up with Loid's thoughts because he thinks too fast about too many things at once, so she makes do by focusing on his surface thoughts once he has decided on a line of thought or course of action. Trying to go any deeper tends to be too strenuous for her to handle. She's outright noted that his mind is so hard to read that she's not even sure how he truly feels about her. Yor's experiences as a Professional Killer makes her mind consider violence all too easily, all while enhancing the gory details of said thoughts. While Yor is all too used to it , such realistic imagery often scares the crap out of Anya . Using telepathy to cheat on a test doesn't help if the classmate she's cribbing off of doesn't know the right answer either. And for the students that do know the right answers, their thoughts often go by too fast for her to understand them or write the answer down. If someone has a particular feeling about something, but doesn't understand it themselves, then Anya won't understand it either. Damian has a crush on her but is in denial because he doesn't think he could ever be in love with a middle-class girl, so Anya has no idea about his true feelings. She can read the minds of animals, but they are substantially harder to read than people given how differently their minds work. She generally can't get more from them than base urges or emotions translated into simple words. Bond is a bit of an exception thanks to his enhanced intelligence, but he still thinks more like a dog than a human and doesn't seem capable of more than simple sentences in his thoughts, which leads to various difficulties when Anya tries to get him to explain things to her. She tries reading the mind of Melinda , who is implied to have some sort of mental illness, and the results leave her incredibly confused. She tries to read the mind of Sigmund but has trouble making sense of what she reads as his thoughts are so scattered. Her mind-reading is limited to whatever thoughts someone is having at the time, so she isn't able to dig into someone's memories or knowledge to look for information. The most she can do is try to get her target to think about the information she needs from them. And more generally, she's still just five years old and doesn't necessarily have the life experience or education to understand what she learns through her telepathy. Lost in Translation : In the original Japanese, she refers to her parents as \"Chichi\" (meaning father) and \"Haha\" (meaning mother). In Japanese, these terms are only used when talking about your parents to another person. So when Anya uses those terms to her own parents, it conveys that she doesn't actually understand the context and formalities of the words, because she's a naive little kid who's never had a proper family. This doesn't get across in languages like English where parents don't have different words based on context, so instead she refers to her parents as \"papa\" and \"mama\" in all contexts. Lunacy : Apparently her power is tied to the moon phase. She loses her mind-reading power during a new moon, forcing her to actually put effort into studying for a test when her original plan was to skim the answers off certain students via their thoughts (though she eventually finds that even with her powers working properly this method is unreliable). Magikarp Power : An intelligence variant. For some time in the series, Anya barely gets by in Eden Academy with her slightly passing grades and outright failing grades at times. It doesn’t help that the lessons and tests are incredibly advanced for the class's expected age, not to mention she's actually underaged . However, with determination and a genuine desire to improve, she slowly but surely gets better results. By 90 chapters in, it pays off with her placing second in her classical language test and now being ranked 168 out of 228. Mark of Shame : As of January 2024, she's gotten three Tonitrus Bolts on record, the first for punching Damian in the face, the second for not having a handkerchief on her ( because she gave hers to Damian ), and the third for a bad grade in her math midterm exam. She also has three Stella Stars, though, so it's anyone's guess as to which one she'll get eight of first. Mark of the Supernatural : She's the only human character in the story that explicitly has supernatural powers through her Telepathy , and physically representing that is her being the only character with unusually pink hair. Meaningful Name : Written as an and ya , her name can mean \"dark night\" in Japanese, contrasting her adoptive parents' names. Later, in imitation of Loid's own codename, she refers to herself as \"Starlight\" Anya every time she gets a Stella Star. Megaton Punch : Her punch on Damian sends him flying into a nearby garbage can. The anime adds an audible boom on the impact of the hit. A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Read : Anya's telepathy often causes her to discover details about people that end up disturbing her, such as Yor's frequent battles with Murder Is the Best Solution and several people relieving themselves in the public pool. Mind over Manners : This trope is the other major reason why she doesn't reveal her Telepathy to other people alongside personal enjoyment . She fears being thrown away as a freak for disrupting the Mutual Masquerade among her adoptive parents. To get around this, she uses Batman Gambits as her way to help them get their actual jobs done. Mistaken for Romance : Due to Anya's attempts to befriend Damian for Loid's mission, Becky thinks Anya has a crush on Damian by Mission 25. Mood-Swinger : As Loid starts regretting his decision in adopting her, Anya begins to cry and begs him to keep her after reading his mind. She instantly stops with glee after Loid offers her peanuts. Mundane Utility : On top of using her mind reading powers for keeping her parents' missions intact and reading the minds of threats, she also uses them to cheat on her exams. This didn't work during the entrance exam since every other entrant was just as freaked out as her without any viable answers, forcing her to remember what Loid taught her with the answer key. Mysterious Past : Her original family, true age, and basically anything past a year before she met Twilight remain largely mysteries. All we have gotten is a short flashback to her time as a research subject, a short dream about her birth mother , and the Eden interview bringing her to tears when the subject of her birth mother comes up, but no additional details have been revealed as of yet. Notably, despite how much the story focuses on Anya and her inner thoughts, whether on purpose or not, she almost never references anything from before she was adopted by Twilight. Plus, Loid has never pressed her for any answers to these things, though he suspects her birth parents are long dead. In Mission 93 he at last pries a little on what Anya's life was like when she was younger, and she claims she remembers little of it. Loid decides to not press further. For that matter, the year before she met Twilight is sparse on detail. We know what happened in outline — she kept getting bounced between foster homes and orphanages — and we have the names of the families who fostered her, but as noted above, she barely references her pre-Twilight life. Naughty Is Good : Unlike the unrealistically angelic and well-behaved children that are typical of the Cold War Era television and films (like Leave It to Beaver and The Sound of Music ) that Spy X Family draws inspiration from, Anya is prone to the stubbornness, impulsiveness, lack of foresight, vanity, fits of selfishness, and tearful tantrums that are characteristic of real children. With that being said, she is an honest and kind soul at heart, still one foot firmly in an idealized world of imagination, adventure, and wonder, yet to be corrupted by the duplicity, malice, and cynicism of the grown-up world. Never Bareheaded : She practically never takes the little horns on her head off, even when sleeping. In the Fashion-Shop Fashion Show in Mission 36, only one out of the numerous outfits she tries doesn't have something that covers or replaces the horns, and it's one with an exaggerated horned hairdo (and it's implied that horns are still there, but underneath the hair). Her flashback to the lab in Mission 1 — set after she'd gained her powers — shows her with Odango Hair instead (or possibly bandages ; the anime opted to make it hair). For the gala in Chapters 95-96, she has her hair done up in Odango Hair with large hair buns, big enough the horns could be underneath. One of the omakes shows her going to the pool and wearing her horns under a swim cap . It's possible her horns can't come off. Mission 111 gives us our first glimpse at Anya's birth mother , who also has vaguely horn-shaped Odango Hair . Subconsciously, perhaps Anya feels attached to the hairstyle/horns for that reason... Nice Girl : For the most part, she is easygoing, kind, innocent, and deeply appreciates having Loid and Yor as her adoptive parents. She even tries to be nice and sympathetic to Damian, even though the latter is constantly rude and condescending towards her. Non-Standard Character Design : Besides her unusual hair color, Anya's eyes are noticeably larger and more exaggerated compared to even the other child characters. There are some panels where she looks more like a character from One Piece or even a chibi . Her eyes do slowly become less detailed as the manga goes on , with the focus instead switched towards giving her a number of exaggerated expressions. Noodle Incident : Before Loid adopted her, she was adopted and returned by four different families. It's anyone's guess as to how her time with them went, with the only clue to them ending badly being that it had something to do with her powers. No Poker Face : When playing Old Maid with Damian, they end up in a stalemate because she can read his mind. However, her facial expressions instantly give away which card is the joker, so it ends up in a tie every time. O-Z Obfuscating Stupidity : Downplayed actually, she's not all that bright on her own (at least some of which may be down to being a year or two younger than she claims), and a lot of her bursts of intelligence are thanks to her reading others' minds, such as when she solves a crossword thanks to Twilight looking over it. That said, she's far more cunning than she lets on and she pulls off multiple Batman Gambits by pretending to be an average child and \"conveniently\" doing things that help accomplish Twilight's missions. Oblivious to Love : She doesn't notice that Damian is mean to her because he has a secret crush on her. Although she can read his mind, they're both little kids who barely have any concept of what romantic love feels like, and so Anya can't make sense of the weird sensations she gets from him sometimes until Chapter 88, where she gets the first hint of Damian's feelings for her (albeit finding it creepy). Oh, Crap! : A Running Gag thanks to her awareness of her adoptive parents'... unique professions and quirks. Only One Name : She's introduced without a surname, although she picked up new ones with every family that fostered her. Whether she was given a surname at birth is unknown. Orphanage of Fear : Given how she's dealt with All of the Other Reindeer throughout all her life, every orphanage she's been in was a crappy one that only barely kept every child alive and fed, let alone cared for her interests and emotional needs. Quite luckily for her, the shady and uncaring nature of such an establishment, particularly the drunk owner who was more than happy to get rid of her, made it very easy to get adopted by Loid and give Anya a chance at living a genuinely happy life. Outside-Context Problem : She's a powerful telepath with undetectable mind reading in an Espionage Thriller world in which such things otherwise do not exist, so not only does no one have any idea how to counter her, no one even knows she's of any significance. Notably Loid never realizes she can read minds despite the numerous Contrived Coincidences surrounding her, despite him being The Ace when it comes to intellect and observational skills, because such a thing is so far outside his worldview he would never even think of it. Paranormal Gambling Advantage : A raffle is rigged by its holder so that his girlfriend gets the grand prize for a 2-person cruise, with only the two of them knowing that the winning ticket is stuck to the top of the box on the inside. Anya, who is in line before said girlfriend, uses her telepathy to read the raffle holder's mind and promptly fishes out the winning ticket from the box, earning her and Loid the cruise trip. Parental Abandonment : Prior to meeeting Twilight, Anya was adopted and returned to the orphanage four times which made her develop abandonment issues. She's shown to be concerned about Loid getting rid of her as soon as the mission is complete, she becomes redundant towards its completion, if he finds out about Yor's secret, etc. Parental Title Characterization : Anya always calls Loid and Yor \"chichi\" and \"haha\" note \"Papa\" and \"Mama\" in the English translation since she's a very young girl. In Japanese, this is grammatically wrong ; \"chichi\" and \"haha\" are how you refer to your parents when talking to someone else, rather than being a form of address, implying Anya simply doesn't know any better because she's never had a family before meeting Loid and Yor. Loid: So please make sure that you address me as \"Father\". Anya: Papa! Loid: Close enough. A very somber example comes when she's recounting her birth mother, and she refers to her as \"mommy\". This word choice is a stark contrast to how she refers to her adoptive family and hints at a lingering grief, especially as she starts dropping tears at the memory. Penny Among Diamonds : Anya is an orphan who was raised as a test subject until she managed to escape from the lab and a secret spy adopted her to enroll her at an elite academy where most of the students belong to rich and influential families. The Forgers' cover identity is far better-off than Anya's actual upbringing, but her classmates still often shun her for \"only\" being upper-middle class. Unlike most examples of this trope (where the characters in question get into this situation as teens), her young age means she often lacks the self-consciousness to \"behave,\" occasionally embarrassing herself in the process. Plucky Girl : Anya is an adventurous soul who manages to stand up to rich jerks and seek truth despite her terrible life experiences. The Pollyanna : She is living proof that even horrible tragedies can give rise to good things , and remains optimistic and able to enjoy life despite her awful childhood. Pop-Cultured Badass : She gets into a lot of trouble trying to be like Bondman , her favorite cartoon hero. The main reason she isn't dead yet is that she's a telepath , in a world where superpowers are almost unknown, and therefore hugely dangerous despite her young age and lack of caution. Positive Friend Influence : Anya's presence invariably brings out the best among her family and friends. Despite being introduced as a cold spy who was willing to abandon her at the sign of trouble, Loid reconnects with the reason why he became a spy in the first place and becomes a protective father who tries his best in keeping Anya out of harm's way. A glowing example is when he finally meets with Donovan; instead of flattering him to get into his good graces, Loid judges him based on his poor parenting and his ruthless nature. Yor married Loid as a cover for her assassin ways, but after Murdoch Swan taunts Anya, Yor immediately jumps to her defense and tries to stop the teacher. Later on, she considers leaving her job in order to be with her family, and while she chooses to stay as an assassin, she does it to further safeguard her family from needless tragedies. Becky is revealed in flashbacks to have been a Spoiled Brat before meeting Anya, but Anya being her Only Friend resulted in her being much nicer towards other people. Damian used to be a bully due to his insecurities regarding winning approval from Donovan, but after getting punched by Anya (and accidentally developing a crush on her), he gradually becomes a much kinder child who doesn't bully anyone anymore, even appreciating the friends he used to see as sycophants. Power Incontinence : Downplayed. Anya's powers don't appear to always be fully active, sparkling effects around her head showing when she is using them and her often declaring she is about to read someone's mind before she does so. That said, her adverse reactions to crowds and her apparent inability to shut out intense feelings of panic or anger suggests that if there are enough thoughts/feelings occurring near her at a high enough intensity, then they basically push themselves into her mind and there is little she can do about it other than wait for the intensity to abate. She also will sometimes receive less intense thoughts without intending to, usually if the thought is of someone she knows thinking something of interest to her. Precision F-Strike : She doesn't swear often, but sometimes- like when getting back at Damian insulting her or describing her adoptive father going to the loo to relieve his feigned stomachache- she does. Prone to Tears : Anya cries a lot when she feels overwhelmed, which is justified since she's a child. She starts comically bawling in the first chapter thinking that Loid is suddenly going to up and abandon her after just adopting her, but he switches her mood around almost instantly after offering to buy her peanuts. Properly Paranoid : Anya aims to help Loid with his mission largely because she wants to make world peace and get him to want to keep her, as she's convinced he'll just want to abandon her when it's over. Given how Loid has mentioned to himself many times once the mission is over he'll never see Anya or Yor ever again, her fears are justified. Psychic Children : Anya can sense the thoughts and emotions of anyone relatively near her (as well as animals, though it's harder). She can get overwhelmed by these sometimes though. Psychic Nosebleed : Overuse of her telepathy can cause this, notably when she used it to track down the purse-snatcher through a big crowd. Trying to filter through all the thoughts to locate his for even a few seconds led to her nose bleeding and Anya almost passing out. Rage Breaking Point : Damian's constant bullying of Anya on the first day of school causes Anya to snap and punch the little brat across the hallway. Really 17 Years Old : While Anya claims to be six years old, Loid surmises that she's about four or five and is lying about her age in order to get adopted, and as stated by Tatsuya Endo in the extras of Volume 13 of the manga, Anya is actually 5 years old. Recruited from the Gutter : Loid adopted Anya from an Orphanage of Fear to serve as his fake daughter for Operation Strix. He doesn't know that she knows all about his secret identity as a spy, and she's not officially \"working\" for him, but she does everything she can to secretly help him, since she doesn't want to lose her new family. Refuge in Audacity : What tends to keep up Anya's deception about having the ability to read minds during her more blatant gaffes trying to hide her abilities. Twilight knows of super-science being performed by each country, but is otherwise skeptical of any of it turning up more than bunk, meaning he never connects the dots with Anya — especially because it would be so difficult to believe and so far removed from what should be possible for humans, even in a setting slightly more fantastical than modern earth. This sometimes allows Anya to just tell Twilight and Yor what she knows with only the barest justification, which can speed along the plot in some areas. Renamed the Same : In Short Mission 11, Loid acknowledges how her door's nameplate says \"ANIA\" and corrected her that it is supposed to be spelled \"ANYA\". Her slight pause and repetition to herself in response hints her undocumented name was previously \"Ania\" (and that may have even been the name given by her birth mother), but she is accepting that she is now \"Anya\". Reused Character Design : Anya greatly resembles the title character of another one-shot manga the author did in the past titled Rengoku no Ashe ◊ , only as a child as opposed to an adult woman. The most notable similarities are the signature \"horns\" hair decorations and pink hair, but Ashe's outfit was also recycled as Eden's uniform (that Anya eventually wears herself) alongside her thorn earring and body shape going to Yor. This even gets referenced in a promo image for Endo's commentary for said one-shot where Ashe and Anya are put next to each other. Mission 111 shows Anya's biological mother for the first time in a flashback; she has a near-identical appearance to Ashe, down to the curly hairstyle. Rose-Haired Sweetie : She's an adorable and innocent little girl with pink hair. Running Gag : Anya has the misfortune of reading her parents' minds when they think about something related to their profession (killing, assassinating, hiding dangerous poisoned weapons, etc.) and gets startled as a result. Anya asks her parents if they're going to kiss (manga)/states that they're flirting (anime) after they have a mutual 'moment', and they deny it in embarrassment. Anytime Anya is asked what her parents do for a living, she almost states the truth that Loid is a spy and Yor is a hitman. Only to quickly stop herself and state what their cover job is. Anya is not exactly tactful about making it clear she doesn't like Yor's cooking, causing her adoptive mother some distress. Anya's imagined results of her parents finding out about each other's true vocations and divorcing always includes them randomly deciding to abandon her as well . Sometimes she also worries about them randomly abandoning her for other reasons. Anya will express shock ( even saying \"Shock!\" out loud ) whenever someone thinks little of her ability to succeed. Starting from Episode 14 of the Anime, her voice drops lower and deeper than even Yor's in anger when she is really shocked, sounding more like a shocked chain-smoker than a young child. Her terrible handwriting, typically presented by someone being given something she wrote on and being horrified or confused at how difficult it is to read. By Mission 88 it gets acknowledged in-universe by Becky as a running gag that is getting old, and it's implied Anya is trying hard to improve. Sage Love Interest : Damian did not want to crush on a telepath who can penetrate his insecurities as if they're tissue paper. Unfortunately, his feelings for Anya are one of the many things in his life he has no control over. Sarcastic Confession : In Chapter 96, Damian asks if she can read minds since she was able to get several questions about him right, she sincerely replies with “Yes. I can read people’s minds.” Naturally, he thinks she is just joking. Saying Sound Effects Out Loud : A Running Gag in the Anime's Japanese language version is Anya incredulously shouting \"Ga-n!!\" , which literally means \"Clang!\" or an onomatopoeia of \"Shock!\", whenever she is well, shocked. This is a trait she shares with her mother Yor. Secretly Selfish : Anya is determined to help Loid succeed in Operation STRIX no matter what, but her desire to befriend Damian, in spite of knowing how his father treats him, stems from her desire to help the mission succeed, not out of any real friendship and more on the grounds she hopes Loid will want to keep her and not return her to foster care. That said, Damian’s constant bullying doesn’t do him any favors. She has started to genuinely sympathize with him more after learning that they both struggle with being unsure if their parents really love them or not, enough to actually confess to him that she can read minds, but she still finds him annoying most of the time and bugs him about his dad. Secret Secret-Keeper : Due to her telepathy, Anya is the only one who knows Loid is a spy and Yor a hitwoman. She keeps quiet because of her own instructions to keep her powers secret. Fortunately, she thinks having a spy and assassin as her parents is awesome. Shipper with an Agenda : Her parents are married for non-romantic and non-intimate reasons, but that doesn't stop her from wanting the two to act as such for real. While part of this is indeed because she sees them as a perfect genuine couple, she also does so because she Hates Being Alone and wants to have a permanent loving family, after spending most of her life either experiencing traumatic experiments or being tossed between uncaring orphanages. [after a Ship Tease situation happens between Loid and Yor] Anya: So, are you going to kiss now? [manga] / Papa and mama are flirting. [anime] Loid/Yor: (blushing) No we're not! A far less serious version of this is Played for Laughs with Becky's crush on Loid, as Anya is willing to entertain her feelings in hopes of living in a mansion and eating fine food prepared by professional chefs. Shipping Torpedo : She actively opposes Fiona replacing Yor as Twilight's fake wife, both because Anya already loves Yor as her mother and because she doesn't in any way approve of Fiona's plan to \"educate\" her. Shout-Out : Her favorite TV character is Bondman, and her lab name was \"Subject 007 \", a reference to long running Spy Fiction character James Bond and his codename \"007\". Signature Hair Decs : No matter what other clothes she might end up wearing, one consistent and quite notable part of her design is a pair of horn accessories attached to the sides of her hair. Signature Sound Effect : In the anime, alongside the sparkling stars that pop up, her usage of telepathy is denoted by a reverberating sparkle noise that matches the visuals. It's so consistent to her that, regardless of seeing the sparkles and hearing the thoughts being read, this sound appearing even when Anya's offscreen instantly signifies that she read someone's thoughts. Spanner in the Works : Quite a few times, though the telepathy helps. Her intervention in the Dog Crisis prevents a war from breaking out and saving Loid. Accidentally reuniting with Yor on the cruise leads her to make everyone think Yor and her opponent are just acting, bagging another victory for Yor. Later, she throws one of Yor's knives to the top of the cruise ship, helping Yor fight the Swordsman on much more even grounds as she now has a weapon to counter his advantage in reach. Knowing that the bomb collar the bus hijackers put on her is a fake helps her keep her cool in the situation and talk their leader into surrendering. After learning that Rodger Hostman plans to kill the college students due to their rash behavior, she tells Loid about exploring the kitchen, thus foiling his plans before he kills anyone. The Spook : Her past as a lab experiment who then bounced through multiple orphanages and foster families left her with little to no documentation; the orphanage Loid finds her in didn't file any paperwork for her adoption. Naturally, that's what Loid was looking for: a child with no legal existence to contradict the cover story of being his biological offspring. Star-Shaped Coupon : Loid's mission is for her to achieve eight Stella Stars so she can become an Imperial Scholar like the son of his target Donovan Desmond, allowing him access to the meetings that Donovan will also attend. As of Mission 93, she's gotten three Stellas: the first for saving a boy from drowning, the second is for her courageous actions when the Eden Academy bus was held hostage by terrorists of the Red Circus, and the third is for getting the second highest grade in her classical language final. Story-Breaker Power : In a series entirely about spycraft and secrecy, Anya's telepathy could easily derail the main plot at any time, and she in fact has derailed numerous plots in-universe simply because she happened to be present. She's restrained by her young age (mentally and physically) and desire to keep her powers a complete secret, out of fear that being found out will result in her losing her new family. In addition, her telepathy has additional benefits. She can also see people’s Imagine Spots and even hear animals as if they can speak like humans. This is played as a punchline in a chapter that sets up a Ten Little Murder Victims plot, but then Anya abruptly ends it by immediately finding the culprit, along with Bond's next vision of where they'd strike next. Stronger Than They Look : Despite being six (or so she claims), her punch was able to send Damian flying across the hallway, thanks to Yor's training. Subtle Superpowering : Or at least, Anya tries to be subtle out of fear of what might happen if others find out. She's relatively competent at it for her age, and it always works—although to the audience it reads closer to Blatant Lies . Summon Bigger Fish : A favored tactic of Anya's when facing adult villains; all she needs to do is to call out for Yor's help, and the latter will arrive within moments with superhuman speed, then proceed to singlehandedly pulverize said villains with her equally superhuman strength and skill. Support Party Member : Being a five-year old girl, Anya has almost zero ability to defend herself, but her ability to read minds allows her to steer Loid, Yor, or any of their allies in the right direction whenever she gets caught in the crossfire of their jobs. The challenge is doing so without revealing that she's an esper. Supporting Protagonist : Loid is by all indications the main character of the series, with his mission providing context to the series as well as the ongoing main plot. However, so much of that plot revolves around Anya, and she has so much insight and context into everyone's secrets, that it ends up hinging primarily on her actions. Suspiciously Specific Denial : Despite her being a Guile Heroine with incredible skill at utilizing her Telepathy powers, she still has the childish trait of trying to subtly lie, only to instead say things that are directly denying the truth. Anya: I'm Anya, and I've always been Papa's daughter. Anya: Papa is taking me out to play and Papa is very nice and Mama is a good person! My family is very ordinary! [...] Papa is also a good person and very normal too! Sweet Tooth : She gets very excited when told her parents brought home a cake. She also happily accepts offers of candy from others like the old woman her parents save from a pickpocket. Taking the Heat : In Chapter 61, she lends her own handkerchief to Damian so he won't get a Tonitrus bolt, because she realizes anything that would jeopardize Damian's relationship with his father would be bad for the mission. Hilariously, because she pictured Loid's ability to always have a move in advance (yet didn't actually follow through by bringing a spare), she didn't realize that she would be the one receiving the Tonitrus instead. Talking in Your Sleep : When Anya dozes off while studying at her desk and Loid moves her to the bed, she says something weird, \"No, mama. You can't kill papa...\" Loid even wonders what she's dreaming about to say this. Talking the Monster to Death : Using her telepathy, she's able to blunder her way through this with one of the Red Circus members, inadvertently pushing his Trauma Buttons and reminding him of his deceased daughter, causing a Heel Realization . Tears of Remorse : Subverted . When Anya apologizes for punching Damian, she overhears his henchmen thinking mean things about her, which makes her cry. Damian mistakes the motive of her tears, taking them as proof of a sincere and heartfelt apology. Telepathy : Anya is an esper who has the ability to read minds, including animals, but notes that's more difficult for her. She doesn't have complete control over it, as large crowds can overwhelm her. There is also a range limit no matter how much she concentrates. Terrible Artist : Her artworks look like grotesque renditions of whatever she was trying to represent. Loid once mistakes one of her drawings as a cheetah, but it was actually a cow. There Are No Therapists : Anya has experienced some pretty traumatic things either directly or via her mind-reading (including a man being shot to death right in front of her, and a vision of finding her father dead in an explosion), and unlike Twilight and Yor she has (as far as we know) not been through any training to acclimate her to such things. However, while the experiences will bother her in the moment, they don't seem to leave any negative lasting impact on her psyche. While she's not necessarily \"normal,\" the only recurring trauma she seems to deal with is the fear of being sent away from her adoptive family (a fear strong enough that she even risked Twilight's life at one point by leaving a messy warning about a bomb rather than risk him finding out about her powers by telling him directly). While the lack of other trauma is unexplained, the lack of attempts at therapy is justified by her parents being unaware that she's seen these things. Third-Person Person : In the original Japanese, she has a habit of referring to herself in third person, which adds to her cuteness. This also happens in the Latin American Spanish dub out of respect for the trope, despite many Latin American countries strongly discouraging such speech. note See the trope under Real Life for a detailed explanation. Keep in mind the dub was made in Mexico, where the stereotypes about this trope are very strong. Three-Point Landing : She actually manages to do such a landing in the beginning of Mission 56. Tomboy and Girly Girl : The Tomboy to Becky's Girly Girl . Anya isn't exactly tomboyish, but she is more stubborn, proactive, prone to seek adventure and thrills, likes action-adventure cartoons, can throw a punch, and doesn't have much interest in fashion. Whereas Becky is an ojou in training who likes romance dramas/soap operas and is interested in fashion and relationships. Took a Level in Badass : As Anya has become more comfortable with her powers and more concerned with how she can use them to help others, she's likewise gotten more competent with them. Being a small child, Anya hasn't become a more powerful person, but she has genuinely learned how to be more charismatic over dozens of chapters. As she's gained stellas, Anya has steadily gone from constantly putting her foot in her mouth and erasing any progress she makes to be valued in the school to legitimately becoming good at winning people over, even if she's still somewhat dependent on luck to get ahead. Trademark Favorite Food : She really likes peanuts and can easily be bribed with them, though it has been downplayed since the earlier chapters and she is shown to like nuts or things similar to them (like cashews) in general. When it comes to drinks she is also particular to hot cocoa. And during dinner time, she loves Hamburg streak whenever Loid makes it. Troubling Unchildlike Behavior : She may have been forced by the circumstances, but she's able to make a functioning IED note Improvised Explosive Device by reading the ingredients and procedure from the mind of the terrorist who's planning to use one to kill Yor and building it first, although hers is fortunately small and nonlethal. The Un-Smile : Yor advised Anya to try to respond to every provocation with a friendly smile. Unfortunately, Anya's fake ◊ smile is one of the smuggest to ever grace any media. \" Mama's a liar; smiling didn't help at all .\" Unadoptable Orphan : Anya was adopted and returned by four foster families in the past, implicitly due to her Telepathy . Unusually Uninteresting Sight : Loid appears to have written off Anya solving the crossword in their first meeting as a fluke. Most people around her do not even see her pink hair as unnatural or abnormal in a setting where characters have mostly-realistic hair colors. Unwitting Instigator of Doom : Shortly after discovering Loid's telegraph in a box, she started playing with it and thought it'd be fun to relay the message 'THIS IS TWILIGHT TAG YOU'RE IT' out, which led to Edgar's men tracking down Loid's apartment, blowing his cover and taking Anya hostage. Verbal Tic : While it gets Lost in Translation to some extent, Anya's speech mannerisms are distinctly childish, even compared to Eden students in her year. Vocal Dissonance : Starting from Episode 14 of the Anime, whenever Anya is really shocked (to the point of Color Failure ) — such as when she realized she couldn't defuse the terrorist bomb, and when she failed to impress Damian with her new dog — Atsumi Tanezaki drops her pitch several octaves lower while incredulously shouting Gaa~n! (Sho~ck!) , making her sound like a chain-smoker with a voice deeper than her gentle mother Yor's rather than that of a young child. Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World : Anya is forced to help her parents maintain world peace. While burdening a child with adult responsibilities is usually a form of child abuse, Anya is taking it upon herself to do it with neither parent's knowledge, largely because she thinks having a spy and an assassin as parents would be cool. That said, Anya does things like befriending a Spoiled Brat and generally trying to do what her parents hope she does, all in the name of being an asset. \"Well Done, Daughter!\" Girl : Anya's only motivated to try to excel in Eden to help Loid fulfill his mission, along with make him (and Yor) keep her as a daughter for as long as possible. She also admits in Mission 37 that she's a little scared of whether Loid actually likes her or not since his mind is so complicated, which is what pushes her to strive so hard at trying to earn his love. When She Smiles : She's very good at invoking this in others. Her happiness often gets Loid and Yor to accept that she is their daughter, adopted or not. Mission 36 was dedicated to Becky taking Anya shopping to make her attractive to Damian. Unbeknownst to them, Damian is staring in flustered awe when he spots Anya laughing happily the next day. Who Writes This Crap!? : Her honest reaction to Loid's homemade \"Spy Wars\" episode which is laden with obviously shoehorned educational facts in an extremely clunky manner, showing that Twilight isn't adept at scriptwriting a show for children. Anya: This cartoon sucks. I can't follow this at all. Wise Beyond Her Years : Played with, in that she is not really good at academics at all, enjoys childish things, and often misunderstands adult matters, but she is also good at observation and knows how to act, lie, and lead everyone along on the spot while hiding her nature, whether to keep her adoptive family on track for their missions or to catch crooks. Wounded Gazelle Gambit : Rare heroic example, where thanks to Anya's mind-reading, she frequently has access to information her parents do not, and needs to indirectly use this to help them accomplish their goals without revealing her secrets to them or their secrets to each other. One time when Loid couldn't chase after a fleeing terrorist, she got Yor to do the job by latching onto the terrorist and screaming to her mother that she's being kidnapped. You Are Better than You Think You Are : A lot of her fears rest in her belief that her psychic powers make her a freak, and once Loid and Yor find out, they'll immediately reject her for being something inhuman. After she saves a boy from drowning, Loid's internal pride towards her convinces her that her powers are a blessing and she learns to accept them as something she can do good with. You Are Number 6 : Anya used to be called Subject 007. You Owe Me : Since getting her second bolt strike, Anya frequently tells Damien he owes her for taking the fall. In fairness, Damien does acknowledge this and tries to pay her back for taking the fall for him.

        "content": "Eevee (Pokémon) Eevee ( Japanese : イーブイ Eievui ) is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I . It evolves into one of eight different Pokémon through various methods. (Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.) Additionally, Eevee has two forms : the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee . It can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Eevee if it has the Gigantamax Factor . The partner Eevee and Eevee with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. Eevee is the game mascot of and the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! . It also serves as the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest . It also is the first Pokémon employee in Pokémon Café Mix . In Pokémon Yellow , Professor Oak had originally intended to give Eevee to the player as their first Pokémon, but it is taken by Blue instead. Contents Biology Eevee is a small, mammalian , quadrupedal Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns . It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving . Eevee can potentially evolve into eight different Evolutions . Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into. [ 1 ] Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Extreme Evoboost . Forms Eevee has two forms: the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee. Partner Eevee The partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken from Pokémon the Series , which implemented similar traits starting in Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire . The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. The white tip on a female partner Eevee 's tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. Before Pokémon Sword and Shield , this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference . As a result, Pokémon GO was updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well. The partner Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the moves Bouncy Bubble , Buzzy Buzz , Sizzly Slide , Glitzy Glow , Baddy Bad , Sappy Seed , Freezy Frost , and Sparkly Swirl , as well as the partner power Veevee Volley . Gigantamax Eevee As Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds circling it. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight. Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious after Gigantamaxing, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size. [ 2 ] Gigantamax Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle . Evolution Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokémon (collectively called Eeveelutions ). (For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data→Evolution data .) Game data NPC appearances Pokédex entries Game locations In side games In events In-game events Wild Area News Poké Portal News Held items Pokémon caught in Generation I must be traded to a Generation II game in order for a held item to appear. Stats Base stats Eevee Partner Eevee Pokéathlon stats Type effectiveness Learnset By leveling up By TM By breeding TCG -only moves Side game data Eevee Body size: Standard (1 tile) How to Recruit : Introduced by Vaporeon Connected to: Vaporeon , Jolteon , Whimsicott Connection Orb Set: 3 #023 25 → (random) 25 + 10 km + → 25 + 10 km + → 25 + → 25 + → 25 + + 70 → In Pokémon GO , Eevee can be obtained by completing 3/8 and 4/8 of the Special Research , A Ripple in Time . Eevee's Shiny variant could also be obtained by completing 4/6 of the time-limited Special Research set, Jump-Start Research . If Eevee has a particular nickname , then once per nickname, it is guaranteed to evolve into the following, regardless of other conditions: Gigantamax Eevee Form data Eevee has two forms: the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee. Only Gigantamax Eevee is recognized by an in-game Pokédex (in Pokémon Sword and Shield and Pokémon HOME ). Partner Eevee has only been named in promotional materials. [ 3 ] Partner Eevee The partner Eevee is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! . Female partner Eevee also have a distinct pattern on their tail (although this was applied to all female Eevee in subsequent generations ); male Partner Eevee and standard Eevee of either gender have the same pattern. It has higher base stats than normal Eevee. Unlike other Eevee, the partner Eevee can learn the exclusive moves Bouncy Bubble , Buzzy Buzz , Sizzly Slide , Glitzy Glow , Baddy Bad , Sappy Seed , Freezy Frost , and Sparkly Swirl , as well as having access to the partner power Veevee Volley . The partner Eevee is not differentiated from standard Eevee in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! 's Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games. Gigantamax Gigantamax Eevee can only be obtained through special methods, and the Gigantamax Factor cannot be bred . Dynamax Band ↔ Evolution data Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokémon (collectively called Eeveelutions ). Eevee can always evolve into Vaporeon , Jolteon , or Flareon when exposed to a Water Stone , Thunder Stone , or Fire Stone , respectively. Since Generation II , Eevee can evolve into Espeon or Umbreon when leveled up with high friendship (220 before Generation VIII or 160 since) during the day /night, respectively. In a few games without a clock , it cannot evolve into Espeon or Umbreon; in Pokémon XD only, Eevee will evolve if the player has the Sun Shard / Moon Shard in their Bag . Since Generation IV , Eevee can evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon when it levels up near a Moss Rock or Ice Rock , respectively. Not all games have Moss and Ice Rocks, so since Generation VIII , Eevee can also evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon when exposed to a Leaf Stone or Ice Stone . Since Generation VI , Eevee can evolve into Sylveon if it knows a Fairy-type move and has high affection (at least two levels) when it levels up. Since affection was folded into friendship in Generation VIII , it can evolve if its friendship is at least 160 instead. If multiple evolutionary conditions are met simultaneously, Leafeon and Glaceon are prioritized over Sylveon , and Sylveon is prioritized over Espeon and Umbreon . The partner Eevee and Eevee with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. Since Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! only include the first 151 Pokémon, wild Eevee can only evolve into Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon in those games. Similarly, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl does not contain Sylveon. This table describes the changes in Evolution eligibility in different games.

Trophy information As adaptable a Pokémon as any yet discovered, Eevee's evolutionary progress changes to meet the conditions of its environment. So far, five evolutionary forms have been discovered and then catalogued for this unique Pokémon; Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, and Umbreon. All evolutions have special benefits. Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U Eevee appears as a Poké Ball Pokémon. It uses Take Down to hit opponents. It also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game. Trophy information NA : This Normal-type Pokémon is as adaptable to evolution as they come, with eight evolutions discovered thus far. If you pair that potential with its adorable features, it's no wonder Eevee is so popular! In Smash Bros., Eevee will attack a nearby opponent with Take Down. Sadly, this attack isn't incredibly powerful. PAL : This adorable Normal-type Pokémon's ability to evolve in so many different ways makes it a popular choice with trainers. When brought out in battle, Eevee uses Take Down on the first opponent it sees, but...it's not very effective. Never mind. Eevee may not be the toughest Pokémon, but it'll always be one of the cutest. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Eevee returns as a Poké Ball Pokémon retaining the same behavior from the previous game. It also appears as two Spirits , Eevee and Partner Eevee. POKÉMON Detective Pikachu An Eevee briefly appeared in POKÉMON Detective Pikachu , under the ownership of Howard Clifford . It evolved into a Flareon . Celestial Eevee appeared in the music video for Celestial . Trivia Origin In the 2018 artbook EVs , Motofumi Fujiwara revealed that the idea for Eevee came from Satoshi Tajiri 's request to have a Pokémon that evolves into multiple types. Fujiwara himself designed Eevee as a \"blank slate\" for its varied Evolutions; as such, while Eevee has traits of foxes, dogs, and cats, it is not based on any specific animal. Fujiwara also envisioned Eevee as a creature that could exist \"in people's memories\"; namely, vague memories of seeing a cat or dog-like creature that players might have experienced in their childhood.

She is a young female dragon who was exiled from her world as punishment of her pranks. Kanna Kamui Characteristics Rōmaji Kanna Kamui Age 9 (appearance) [ 2 ] Birthday Unconfirmed [ 1 ] Gender Female Hair Color White-lavender Eye Color Blue Faction Unaffiliated Relatives Kimun Kamui (father) Characteristics Rōmaji Age Birthday Gender Hair Color Eye Color Faction Relatives First Appearance Manga Debut Chapter 5 Anime Debut Episode 1 First Appearance Manga Debut Anime Debut Portrayal Seiyū Maria Naganawa English Jad Saxton Portrayal Seiyū English Contents Appearance Kanna's full appearance in the anime. In her human form, Kanna has white-lavender hair in ponytails and blue eyes. According to Riko Saikawa , she is very cute and appealing. Her style of clothing has been described as \"gothic lolita with a tribal theme\" (courtesy of Kobayashi). Her usual attire consists of a white capelet with a fur collar, a pink blouse, a white frilly skirt, and red doll shoes. She ties her hair into pigtails, each adorned with three dark blue beads. She has four horns (one facing up and down on each side) and a long thin tail that ends in a puffy ball, similar to that of a poodle. In between her horns is a black headband with in the middle of the headband is a small bow attached to it. In the anime, Kanna's hair is given an extra shade of purple at the tips. Kanna wears a light pink frock in place of her usual clothing during the summer months and a yellow nightgown to sleep. Kanna's true form In her dragon form, she appears as a feathered white dragon with blue eyes. Like Tohru , she hides her tail and wings when outside. Unlike Tohru, she also hides her horns when outside. Her height is 120cm while in human form and 10m as a dragon and her measurements are B60/W50/H55. Personality Kanna accuses Kobayashi and Tohru of being perverts. Kanna is soft-spoken and quiet and demonstrates most of her emotions through minute expressions. Despite being technically older than her human peers, Kanna behaves no differently from a human child as she easily tires of routine and enjoys playing games. However, despite her generally unexpressed and implicit demeanor, Kanna is not without emotion, indicated when she has a sudden outburst and cries when Riko Saikawa initially views Kanna as a rival instead of being friends. Kanna may also have romantic feelings for Riko, expressing a desire for a similar relationship to what Kobayashi and Tohru have. Additionally, Kanna is thankful for their friendship. According to Tohru, she is quite mischievous and enjoys playing pranks, though this was an ultimately futile effort to obtain her parents' attention. When Kanna arrives in the modern world, she is initially distrustful or curious about most belongings in the modern world but is revealed to enjoy many things she discovers. Once Kanna discovers something she is attracted to, she becomes very possessive, indicated when she refuses to leave Kobayashi, despite having a distrustful attitude towards her before. She appears to be attached to many other individuals as well, such as Tohru, and briefly Riko Saikawa. Kanna is naturally observant and curious but is confused as to how she should react to the modern world, questioning as to whether or not she gets along with her classmates. Background As punishment for her pranks, Kanna is temporarily exiled to the modern world to reflect on her actions. Plot Once Kanna learns that Tohru survived her last battle with a god and is currently living in the modern world, she searches for her in hopes of returning with her to their world. However, when Tohru refuses to return, Kanna accuses Kobayashi of seducing Tohru. But seeing as Kanna has nowhere else to go, Kobayashi then offers the young dragon to stay with her. Later in the series, after Kanna shows interest in attending a human school, Kobayashi enrolls her in Oborozuka Elementary and accompanies her along with Tohru to shop for school supplies. Kanna develops a familial relationship with the two while living with them. Powers and Abilities Kanna generating electricity. Like all dragons, Kanna's physical strength is superhuman as she is strong enough to throw Tohru several miles up into the air and was able to stand toe-to-toe against Lucoa and Fafnir in their game of dodgeball. Kanna can generate and manipulate electricity. Unlike Tohru, who can generate her mana to sustain her frequent magic usage, Kanna has to absorb mana from her surroundings. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the human world, there is little mana for her to absorb in the air; however, she soon found out that she can replenish her mana by plugging her tail into a wall socket. Due to her inexperience and young age, she cannot cast certain spells that Tohru can, such as Perception Blocking. Relationships Tohru Tohru petting Kanna into sleep.

She is currently living with Kobayashi and Tohru in Kobayashi's apartment compound. She is voiced by Maria Naganawa in the Japanese version of the anime, and by Jād Saxton in the English version of the anime. Contents Appearance [ ] As a human, Kanna appears as a young girl with long white hair (with purple tips in the anime) that splits into two ponytails with three large beads. She has four horns (one facing up and down on each side) and a long thin tail that ends in a puffy ball, similar to that of a poodle. She can freely hide both the horns and tail to blend in with humans, and can also manifest his wings in human form to fly without fully transforming. Normally, She wears a thigh-length dress similar to clothes traditionally worn by the Ainu people, leading her to be called Goth. In her school uniform, his outfit remains the same but it omits the horns and the tail in order to prevent her classmates and her teacher to know her as a dragon. She also wears a yellow hat, a sticker, and a backpack. Her dragon form has a beaked mouth, is covered in fur or feathers, has a pair of feathered wings, and her tail is longer and thicker in comparison to his humanoid form's. Personality [ ] Kanna appears stoic, rarely changing her facial expression or raising her voice, but is actually very emotional. While young by dragon standards, she is more mature than her apparent age would suggest, and when angry she can be foul-mouthed and rude. Due to her young age, Kanna enjoys frequent naps and has a ravenous appetite, frequently snacking and eating any animal she can fit into her mouth, including insects, crabs, and fish. Tohru notes that she is mischievous and enjoys playing pranks, though this was in an ultimately futile effort to obtain her parents' attention. While this tendency lessens over time, she's not above using her cuteness or faking sadness to manipulate others' emotions. Initially jealous of Kobayashi's relationship with Tohru, she has latched onto the human woman as a surrogate mother - to the point of calling herself Kanna Kobayashi - and views Tohru as an older sister. She also has romantic feelings towards Riko Saikawa, expressing a desire for a relationship similar to what Kobayashi and Tohru have.
