        "content": "Eevee Eevee ( Eievui evolutionis ) ( Japanese : イーブイ romanized: Eievui ), the Evolution Pokémon. It is a normal-type Pokémon with the uncanny ability to adapt masterfully to it’s surroundings, allowing it the widest known range of possible evolutions of any of the Pocket Monsters; this is due to an irregularly shaped genetic structure. They are naive by nature, which may explain their rarity in the wild, as it may indicate that they have become critically endangered , and even more likely close to becoming extinct in the wild , as they are almost exclusively found in cities and towns. Nothing is officially known though, except that this species has a strong repel of your balls (maybe you should wash them mate). Known evolutions, more commonly referred to as \"eeveelutions\", are listed below: Contents Biology [ ] Eevee are mammalians, they have long, pointed ears. They have primarily brown fur (silver in the case of shiny Pokémon), with a cream coloration to both the tip of their bushy tails and a large furry collar. Their short, slender legs have three small toes, with footpads of a pink hue. Their eyes are brown, while their small nose is black. Making them look like a dog. Eevee are a mix of rabbit, cat, and fox. It's a common misconception that they're only foxes based on their fox-like tails, but their rabbit-like ears and short round face disprove this. Evolutions [ ] Its wildly contrasting stages would almost make one think these all these creatures are at completely different ends of the gene pool. However, these are all, in fact, the same species. Eevee evolves into various forms depending on the conditions it is placed in. Flareon (Fire) [ ] Flareon Flareon , the Flame Pokémon, is the Fire-type evolution of this species. They have red-orange fur with yellow tufts and a yellow tail, resembling fire. They are best known for their fire manipulation and generation attacks. They evolve from Eevee that are given a fire stone. Leafeon (Grass) [ ] Leafeon Leafeon , the Verdant Pokémon, is Eevee's Grass-type evolution, that is achieved when an Eevee levels up near a Mossy Rock or by being exposed to Leaf Stone. Though they superficially resemble a plantimal, they are actually 100% mammal. The main portion of their bodies are pale yellow, with brown socks on their feet, and their ears and tail resemble leaves and foliage. They also have multiple green leafy spurs on their body. Jolteon (Electric) [ ] Jolteon Jolteon , the Lightning Pokémon, is the evolution that is gained via exposing an Eevee to a Thunder Stone. They are yellow in color, with a white mane. Their fur appears spiky, and unlike their basic form and other final forms of their species, they appear to lack a tail. Sylveon (Fairy) [ ] Sylveon Sylveon , the Intertwining Pokémon, evolves from Eevee that are leveled up while knowing Fairy-type moves. Their fur is mostly white, with pink ears and tail, and splashes of blue on their ribbon-like feelers. These feelers enable them to read their trainer's emotions. Vaporeon (Water) [ ] Vaporeon Vaporeon , the Bubble Jet Pokémon, is the form of Eevee that is achieved when an Eevee is exposed to a Water Stone. While they superficially resemble some kind of blue merlion, with their fish-like fins and tail, they are actually 100% mammal. When an Eevee evolves into this stage, their ears turn into fins, and they gain a large dorsal fin on their heads. Espeon (Psychic) [ ] Espeon Espeon , the Sun Pokémon, is the form achieved through either leveling up an Eevee with high Friendship during the day, or levelling up with high Friendship and a Sun Shard. They can be distinguished by their slender form, lavender body, forked tail and what appears to be a red gem on their foreheads. They share physical characteristics with the Nekomata and the Carbuncle. Umbreon (Dark) [ ] Umbreon Umbreon , the Moonlight Pokémon, is the form achieved through either leveling up an Eevee with high Friendship during the night, or levelling up with high Friendship and a Moon Shard. They are black all over with deep scarlet eyes, and yellow ring-shaped markings can be found on their shoulders and thighs, forehead, and around their long pointed ears and tail. They are slender and sleek in build. Glaceon (Ice) [ ] Glaceon Glaceon , the Fresh Snow Pokémon, is the evolution of Eevee that is obtained when an Eevee is exposed to an Ice Stone. They are a frosty pale blue in color, with darker blue markings, and they have angular ears, tails and facial features that resemble icicles.
